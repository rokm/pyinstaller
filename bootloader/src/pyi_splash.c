/**
 * Splash Screen Feature
 *
 * A splash screen is a graphical window in which a program-defined screen
 * is displayed. It is normally used to give the user visual feedback,
 * indicating that the program has been started.
 *
 * In this file the splash screen feature as of discussed in pyinstaller#4354 is
 * implemented. To show a splash screen the Tk library is used. Tk is accessed by
 * and distributed with Tcl inside the python standard library (as of python 3.8
 * with Tcl/Tk 8.6). Python uses Tcl/Tk in the tkinter module. Tkinter is a wrapper
 * between python and Tcl, so using tkinter will use Tcl/Tk. Because tkinter is
 * distributed with any common python installation and it is cross-platform,
 * it is also used for this splash screen.
 *
 * If splash screen is enabled, PyInstaller bundles all necessary Tcl/Tk resources
 * for inclusion in the frozen application. This results in a slightly bigger
 * application distribution if a splash screen is used, but it is assumed to be negligible.
 *
 * Tcl is a simple high-level programming language like python. It is often embedded into
 * C application for prototyping. Together with Tk (called Tcl/Tk) it is a very powerful
 * tool to build graphical user interfaces and is often used to give C applications
 * a GUI, since it is easy to embed.
 *
 * The implementation of splash screen looks for splash screen resources in the frozen
 * application's archive; if found, it dynamically loads the Tcl and Tk shared libraries,
 * initializes a minimal Tcl/Tk environment, and runs the splash screen in it.
 *
 * Only threaded Tcl is supported; i..e, Tcl had to be compiled with the --enable-threads
 * flag, which is it by default on Windows and MacOS. Many Linux distributions also come
 * with threaded Tcl installation, although it is not guaranteed. PyInstaller checks at
 * build time if Tcl is threaded and raises an error if it is not.
